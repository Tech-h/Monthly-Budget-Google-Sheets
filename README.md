Due to wanting to keep the script with app script and avoid the hastle of using an IDE for a small project like this, if you want to use this code, just copy and paste it into your own app script project for google sheets.
This is a version 0.1 of the project, and doesns't have the ability to generate things like a template for itself yet. I will continue to work on this project over time.
